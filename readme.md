# Dragon

> A fast text editor standby, built with **Rust**.

We all hope to have a text-editor of our own and more easy-to-use than vim or emacs, so there it is.

# Installation

To install **dragon**, simply using:

```
./install_dragon.sh
```

You can also build from source, I assume you are familiar with **Rust**, using cargo to build it.



## Usage

**dragon** is so easy to use. simply like:

- `ctrl+Q`: quit the editor;
- `i`: enter insert mode;
- `esc`: back to normal mode;
- `s`: save file in normal mode

That's all. If you want to copy and paste usage, you can using `d` and `y` and `x` in `v mode` just like vim but more convenient in **dragon**.
